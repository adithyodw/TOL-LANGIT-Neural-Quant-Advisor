## ⚠️ ATTENTION: PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY
**This EA is NOT designed for beginners or those seeking "magic" auto-profit buttons.**

This is a sophisticated quantitative tool. Do NOT use this EA unless you possess a firm grasp of professional trading mathematics. You are expected to fully understand:
* **Calculations:** Manual calculation of pips, points, and tick values.
* **Position Sizing:** The math behind Risk-to-Reward ratios and margin requirements.
* **Recovery Logic:** The mathematical risks and mechanics of Grid and Martingale systems.
* **Market Dynamics:** Distance, slippage, and spread impact on execution.

*If you are looking for a "get rich quick" scheme without learning the math, this tool is not for you.*

## 🧠 STRATEGY LOGIC
TOL LANGIT processes market data through a multi-layered quantitative process:

1. **Trend Filter (EMA):** Uses a 200-period EMA for institutional noise reduction.
2. **Regime Classification (ADX):** ADX(14) > 25 confirms trend strength. Uses DI+/- as mathematical "neurons" to identify trend probability, skipping choppy markets.
3. **Volatility Confirmation (ATR):** Bands = Mid ± 3.5 × ATR. Signal triggers only on volatility-backed crosses in the direction of the macro trend.

---

## 🛡️ RISK CONTROLS
* **Precision Lot Sizing:** `Lot = (Equity × Risk%) / (SL_pts × TickValue)`
* **Equity Guard:** 5% Total Equity Drawdown hard-stop.
* **Daily Limits:** 1% Max Daily Loss & 5 trades per day cap.
